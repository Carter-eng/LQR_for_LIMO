# LQR_for_LIMO
This repo provides the code for creating a tracking controller using a linear quadratic regulator
for the AgileX Limo robots found in Boston University's Robotics and Autonomous Systems Teaching and Innovation Center (RASTIC).

This setup uses ROS to communicate control inputs to the robots and is designed to be an educational tool for students
wanting to use these robots.

A tutorial on using the LQR and the Limos with the rastic motion capture space will be placed here soon.
